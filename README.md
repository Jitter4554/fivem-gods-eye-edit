# God's Eye

## This is a fork of Leocroatian's God's eye

- I changed the script to make it go off jobs through qb(x) and moved it to a command (ive not tested my edits YET if it doesnt work LMK ill get it fixed)


## 📣 | Information
- This script was intended to mimic how God's Eye worked in Fast and Furious. The person that initiated the search MUST be near the marker if not it will disable the tracking and keep the cooldown (300 seconds / 5 minutes)
- If the player is untrackable it will automatically stop drawing the blip.

## 📝 | Features
- Track any player on the server
- Refresh the tracking every 15 seconds
- Shows a radius of where the player might be.
- Auto shutdown if the player is not able to be found.

## 🧵 | Requirements
- ox_lib
